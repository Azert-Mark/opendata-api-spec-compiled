# Open Data API Specification

The Open Data API specifications allow API providers (e.g. banks, building societies and ATM providers) to develop API endpoints which can then be accessed by API users (e.g. third party developers) to build mobile and web applications for banking customers.

These specifications allow providers to supply up to date, standardised, information about the latest available products and services so that, for example, a comparison website can more easily and accurately gather information, and thereby develop better services for end customers.

Specifications for version 2 of the Open Data API are now available at https://www.openbanking.org.uk/open-data-apis/. 

Version 2 is a significant upgrade. New API providers should use these standards. Existing API providers should update to version 2 as soon as they can. Clarification of live dates for version 2 will be posted here soon.
